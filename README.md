# tabpad
A Google Chrome extension to provide a "scratchpad" for notes on the "New Tab" page. Take notes, jot down reminders, 
or write yourself a poem and have it available every time you open a new tab.

## Installation
The easiest way to install TabPad is to add it to Chrome via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabpad/egicgkjdobefbigmkkkgdanmfobgcafb).

If you want to install TabPad locally for development, download the packaged zip file (or clone this repo) and go to `chrome://extensions` and make sure that Developer Mode is turned on. Once enabled, click the button labeled "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the `tabpad` folder on your computer.
